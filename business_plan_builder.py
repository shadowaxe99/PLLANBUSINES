            'Executive Summary': 'The executive summary is a brief overview of your business and your plans. It comes first in your plan and is ideally only one to two pages. Most people write it last, though.',

            'Market Analysis': 'The market analysis is a crucial section of your business plan as it establishes your understanding of the market and industry. It should include information about your target market, its size, its key players, and its growth potential.',
            'Organization and Management': 'This section should include your company’s organizational structure, details about the ownership of your company, profiles of your management team, and the qualifications of your board of directors. It should also include information about how your business is legally structured, such as whether it is a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or limited liability company.',

Explain how it is different from similar products on the market, and discuss your plans for intellectual property protection, such as patent, copyright, or trademark.',

How are you going to market your business and persuade your target audience to buy? What is your sales strategy? How will you price your product or service, position it in the market, and promote it?',

You should also provide a financial forecast for the next three to five years, including projected revenue, expenses, and profitability.',
            'Appendix': 'An appendix to your business plan isn’t a required chapter by any means, but it is a useful place to stick any charts, tables, definitions, legal notes, or other critical information that either felt too long or too out-of-place to include elsewhere in your business plan. It can also include additional information about your products or services, such as technical specifications, drawings, or brochures.'
