Shared Dependencies:

1. Database Schema: All files that interact with the database will use the same schema defined in "database_setup.sql". This includes table names, column names, and relationships.

2. Config Variables: The "config.py" file will contain shared configuration variables such as database credentials, API keys, and other system-wide settings. These variables will be imported and used in "main.py", "data_collection.py", "ai_integration.py", "financial_computation.py", and "report_generation.py".

3. Function Names: Functions defined in one file may be used in another. For example, functions for data collection in "data_collection.py" might be used in "main.py" and "ai_integration.py". Similarly, functions for AI integration in "ai_integration.py" might be used in "main.py" and "report_generation.py".

4. Message Names: Standardized message names for user prompts and system notifications will be shared across "main.py", "data_collection.py", "ai_integration.py", "financial_computation.py", "report_generation.py", and "feedback_system.py".

5. DOM Element IDs: JavaScript functions in "report_generation.py" will use specific DOM element IDs for data visualization. These IDs will also be used in the HTML templates for the final report.

6. Data Formats: The format of data passed between functions and files will be consistent. For example, the format of data collected in "data_collection.py" will match the expected input format in "ai_integration.py" and "financial_computation.py".

7. README Instructions: The "README.md" file will contain instructions and information that are relevant to all other files, such as setup, usage, and troubleshooting instructions.
